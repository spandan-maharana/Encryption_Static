# Encryption_Static
This is the source code for static encryption of numbers.
Given 4 n-digit integers,from which a pin is generated by using the minimum of the digits of the all 4 integers. With the pin above
  generated we use it to encrypt a message.
At the console input 4 n-digit numbers and then  pin is choosen at random from the 4 numbers and then the message gets encrypted.
